Packaging for the NCI Cloud OpenStack fork
------------------------------------------

This repository contains spec files for packaging the NCI Cloud fork of
OpenStack. It will also contain any additional files necessary.

Extra Files
-----------

Under the extra-files directory are the extra non-source files (i.e. files
that are directly related to the packaging, rather than part of the general
source tree). They are specified in the .spec files, and copied into the
SOURCES directory under rpmbuild for packaging.
